# PS4 5.50 Kernel Exploit
---
## Summary
In this project you will find a full implementation of the "ipv6 uaf" kernel exploit for the PlayStation 4 on 5.50. It will allow you to run arbitrary code as kernel, to allow jailbreaking and kernel-level modifications to the system. will launch the usual payload launcher (on port 9020).

## Patches Included
The following patches are applied to the kernel:
1) Allow RWX (read-write-execute) memory mapping (mmap / mprotect)
2) Syscall instruction allowed anywhere
3) Dynamic Resolving (`sys_dynlib_dlsym`) allowed from any process
4) Custom system call #11 (`kexec()`) to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode
5) Allow unprivileged users to call `setuid(0)` successfully. Works as a status check, doubles as a privilege escalation.
6) (`sys_dynlib_load_prx`) patch
## Notes
- The page will crash on successful kernel exploitation, this is normal
- There are a few races involved with this exploit, losing one of them and attempting the exploit again might not immediately crash the system but stability will take a hit.
