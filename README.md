#ps4exploitSAK(*SwissArmyKnife*)
#
# While clearing old clutter files off my phone i found a collection of the basic netcat or similar exploit
# chains for firmware 5.05, 5.50, 5.53, 5.55-5.56, 6.00-6.02, 6.50-6.51, 6.70-6.72, 7.00-7.02.
# theres a bonus though, fellow github user Hippie68 had created the in my opinion and as
# far as recent testing goes(on one ps4 fat 1001a on 7.00, and a ps4 slim on 7.50) in terms of the 7.50 
# has resulted in the least amount of KP on the slim 7.50 when it would take 
# me about 2 dozen FailedJB-REBOOT-/KP scenarios or so before achieving full RWX that would
# not KP in 5 minutes or so after loading a payload, but Hippie68 has included speed/stability
# fixes you may enable should you so choose which the first time i ran the 7.00 fat and exploiting using
# his menu i got stable hen and disable updates as well as fanspeed after only 3 OOM popups vs around
# 15 average any host or method.
# Creditz: i forgot where i got the majority of these exploits, they are all public, and hippie68's menu
# is left intact, aside from the text size mid exploit log pane, i changed ut from "large" to "x-large" 
# for easier viewing. i thank everyone involved in the homebrew community, without them, the devs, 
# or the pwners, none of this would be posible.
